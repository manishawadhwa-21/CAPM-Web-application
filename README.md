CAPM (Capital Asset Pricing Model)

CAPM is a model that describes the relation between the expected return and risk of securities

CAPM indicates that the expected return on a security is equal to the risk free return plus a risk premium

ri = rf+Bi (rm - rf)

ri = Expected return on a security

rf = Risk free rate of return

Bi = Beta between the stock and the market

rm = Expected return of the market

Risk Free Asset Return

• A risk free asset could be a US Government 10 year Treasury bill.

• Investors who are extremely risk averse would prefer to buy the risk free asset to protect their money and earn a low return.

• If investors are interested in gaining more return, they have to bear more risk compared to the risk free asset

Market Portfolio Return

• Market portfolio includes all securities in the market. A good representation of th emarket portfolio is the S&P 500.

Market portfolio return is the average return of the overall return of the SP500.

Beta = It is a measure of a stock's risk (volatility of returns) reflected by measuring the fluctuation of its price changes relative to the overall market
